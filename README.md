This project is a full-stack healthcare platform developed using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), built in VS Code. It allows users to manage medical records, appointments, and prescriptions digitally with a focus on a patient-first design. The frontend is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive and clean UI, while React Router enables smooth navigation across pages. Secure authentication is implemented using JWT, ensuring data protection and privacy. Users can upload and access their medical documents via Google Drive API, enabling safe cloud-based storage. The platform works seamlessly across devices and ensures an intuitive experience for both patients and doctors.
